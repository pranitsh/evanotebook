# EvaNotebook
EvaNotebook is a computational notebook specifically designed to operate solely within a browser environment, without the need for a client-server architecture. Its
design lends itself to the development of prototypes, experimental processes, and system scenarios with a main emphasis on multilingual programming for event-driven
architectures. It achieves this with the assistance of a decentralized database and incorporates various application protocols, including WebRTC, WebSockets, and MQTT,  providing a higher level of abstraction.

üî• Key Features:
* User-friendly WYSIWYG interface inspired by Notion (EditorJS)
    
* Since real applications are reactive ones rather than static ones, so it offers simplified APIs for MQTT, WebRTC, HTTP, and WebSocket protocols based on RxJS.  
    
* Independent web workers for enhanced performance and stability
    
* Secure P2P collaboration with custom replication (RxDB and libp2p) but offline first
    
* Reactive elements like reactive charts, forms, and notebook itself. You can use them with LangChain.

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap:
* Implement Bluetooth, gRPC, GraphQL and SSH protocols. Call your operating system from a browser should be possible securely. 
* Bypass transparently CORS restrictions. 
* Integrate [Langchain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/) to control whatever environment you want (including the notebook itself) in real-time using the different protocols and languages provided by libp2p. Integrate offline large models such as WebGPT.
* Built-in open source alternatives to commercial AI products.
* Jupyter Notebook format complaint.
